## About The Project

As part of my first at General Assembly, I created a speed typing game.

Typer Thriller is a speed typing game for users to improve their typing skills.

I chose to push my CSS and Javascript knowledge through this project, looking into animation properties in CSS, working with sprites to creating moving parts. Coupled with Javascript to provide the game loop logic and the ability to affect change through user response.
